# Monta Vista MUN Graphics

This repository contains graphics for Monta Vista MUN. To use these designs with Google Workspace services, please consult the [Design Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nfyKwX_gjtxmoT8p4e-wENJRNvE-Ptq3?usp=sharing) folder in the Drive. [This file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S73qZxO8ZfxSX6TiNggLAUMElTiNzWMa3onrMSGgRls/edit?usp=sharing) is usually your best bet, but if you’re looking for something specific (e.g. a presentation template or a Google Forms banner image) there might be something purpose-made for that already.

## Directory Structure

## Which folder should I look in?

The `PNG` and `SVG` folders contain finished designs. On the off chance that you're looking for a previous design, the `Old Designs` folder is your best bet. `Drafts` contains only unfinished designs.

## Why is there only one SVG file?

The SVG file should contain multiple layers with different variations of the components. I recommend using the layers for 20px cutouts which I've found works best at a range of different sizes. There is one layer for the UN logo without continents and with a 20px border around the matador, and another layer that is the same design but with fewer latitudinal rings on the globe.
