## Which folder should I look in?

The `PNG` and `SVG` folders contain finished designs. On the off chance that you're looking for a previous design, the `Old Designs` folder is your best bet. `Drafts` contains only unfinished designs.

## Why is there only one SVG file?

The SVG file should contain multiple layers with different variations of the components. I recommend using the layers for 20px cutouts which I've found works best at a range of different sizes. There is one layer for the UN logo without continents and with a 20px border around the matador, and another layer that is the same design but with fewer latitudinal rings on the globe.
