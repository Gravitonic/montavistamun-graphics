# Monta Vista MUN Graphics

This repository contains graphics for Monta Vista MUN. To use these designs with Google Workspace services, please consult the [Design Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nfyKwX_gjtxmoT8p4e-wENJRNvE-Ptq3?usp=sharing) folder in the Drive. [This file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S73qZxO8ZfxSX6TiNggLAUMElTiNzWMa3onrMSGgRls/edit?usp=sharing) is usually your best bet, but if you’re looking for something specific (e.g. a presentation template or a Google Forms banner image) there might be something purpose-made for that already.

## Directory Structure

```
root
├── Drafts
├── Old Designs
├── PNG
└── SVG
```

## Which folder should I look in?

The `PNG` and `SVG` folders contain finished designs. On the off chance that you're looking for a previous design, the `Old Designs` folder is your best bet. `Drafts` contains only unfinished designs.

## Not sure which file to download?

If you’re looking for an SVG but aren’t sure which version will work best for your purposes, the [master copy](SVG/MUN%20Logo%20(Master%20Copy).svg) file contains several different layers that you can toggle, including options for the number of rings in the globe and the width of the border around the matador.

## Looking for optimized files?

Optimized SVGs (generated with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)) are available in the [`SVG/minified`](SVG/minified) folder.
